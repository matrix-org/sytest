# SyTest Docker Images

These Dockerfiles create containers for running SyTest in various
configurations. SyTest is not included in these images, but its dependencies
are.

Included currently is:

- matrixdotorg/sytest, a base container with SyTest dependencies installed
- matrixdotorg/sytest-synapsepy2, a container which will run SyTest against Synapse on Python 2.7
- matrixdotorg/sytest-synapsepy3, a container which will run SyTest against Synapse on Python 3.5
- matrixdotorg/sytest-dendrite, a container which will run SyTest against Dendrite

## Using the containers

Once pulled from Docker Hub, a container can be run on a homeserver checkout:

### Synapse

```
docker run --rm -it -v /path/to/synapse\:/src -v /path/to/where/you/want/logs\:/logs matrixdotorg/sytest-synapsepy3
```

### Dendrite

```
docker run --rm -it -v /path/to/dendrite\:/src -v /path/to/where/you/want/logs\:/logs matrixdotorg/sytest-dendrite
```

This will run on the same branch in SyTest as the checkout, if possible, but
will fall back to using either Synapse or Dendrite's `develop` branch.

If you want to use an existing checkout of SyTest, mount it to `/sytest` inside
the container by adding `-v /path/to/sytest\:/sytest` to the docker command.

You can pass arguments to sytest by adding them at the end of the docker
command. For example, you can use

```
docker run --rm -it ... matrixdotorg/sytest-synapsepy3 tests/20profile-events.pl
```

to run only a single test.

### Environment variables

The following environment variables can be set with `-e` to control the test run:

Synapse:

 * `POSTGRES`: set non-empty to test against a PostgreSQL database instead of sqlite.
 * `WORKERS`: set non-empty to test a worker-mode deployment rather than a
   monolith.
 * `OFFLINE`: set non-empty to avoid updating the python or perl dependencies.

Dendrite:

Dendrite does not currently make use of any environment variables.

## Building the containers

The containers are built by executing `build.sh`. You will then have to push
them up to Docker Hub:

```
docker push matrixdotorg/sytest
docker push matrixdotorg/sytest-synapsepy2
docker push matrixdotorg/sytest-synapsepy3
docker push matrixdotorg/sytest-dendrite
```
