# Instead of using `--no-cache-dir`, we specify a `--cache-dir` and delete it
# afterwards. This works around a bug where `msgpack` gets installed to
# `site-packages`, where Python can't find it, instead of `dist-packages`, when
# using `setuptools>=48.0.0` and the `--no-cache-dir` option.

# As part of the Docker build, we attempt to pre-install Synapse's dependencies
# in the hope that it speeds up the real install of Synapse. To make this work,
# we have to reuse the same virtual env both times. There are three ways to do
# this with poetry:
#  1. Ensure that the Synapse source directory lives in the same path both
#     times. Poetry creates and reuses a virtual env based off the package name
#     ("matrix-synapse") and directory path.
#  2. Configure `virtualenvs.in-project` to `true`. This makes poetry create or
#     use a virtual env at `./.venv` in the source directory.
#  3. Run poetry with a virtual env already active. Poetry will use the active
#     virtual env, if there is one.
# We use the second option and make `.venv` a symlink.

# is being up/downgraded in `scripts/synapse_sytest.sh`. Configure poetry to

#       config option instead.
# poetry has a bug where this environment variable is not converted to a
# boolean, so we choose a falsy string value for it. It's fixed in 1.2.0,
# where we'll be wanting to use `installer.max-workers` anyway.
