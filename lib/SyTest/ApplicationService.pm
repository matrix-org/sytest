=head1 NAME

C<SyTest::ApplicationService> - abstraction of a single application service

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An instance of this class represents an abstracted application service for the
homeserver to talk to. It provides the test scripts a way to receive inbound
HTTP requests and respond to them, and allows access to the user information
allowing a test script to send API requests.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=cut

=head2 new

   $appserv = SyTest::ApplicationService->new( $info, $await_http )

Returns a newly constructed instance that uses the given C<ASInfo> structure
and the C<await_http> function.

{
   my $class = shift;

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 info

   $info = $appserv->info

Returns the C<ASInfo> structure instance this object was constructed with.

=cut

sub info
{
   my $self = shift;
   return $self->{info};
}

=head2 await_http_request

   $f = $appserv->await_http_request( $path, @args )

A wrapper around the C<await_http_request> function the instance was
constructed with, that prepends this server's path prefix onto the C<$path>
argument for convenience.

=cut

sub await_http_request
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( $path, @args ) = @_;

   $self->{await_http}->( $self->info->path . $path, @args );
}

=head2 await_event

   $f = $appserv->await_event( $type )

Returns a L<Future> that will succeed with the next event of the given
C<$type> that the homeserver pushes to the application service.

=cut

sub await_event
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( $type ) = @_;

   my $failmsg = SyTest::CarpByFile::shortmess(
      "Timed out waiting for an AS event of type $type"
   );

   push @{ $self->{futures_by_type}{$type} }, my $f = Future->new;

   return Future->wait_any(
      $f,

      main::delay( 10 )
         ->then_fail( $failmsg ),
   );
