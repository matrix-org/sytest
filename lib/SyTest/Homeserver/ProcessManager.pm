=head1 NAME

C<SyTest::Homeserver::ProcessManager>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is a mixin for C<SyTest::Homeserver> implementations (or, in fact,
any C<IO::Async::Notifier> class) which start external processes.

=cut

struct ProcessInfo => [qw( process finished_future output_lines print_output )];

=head1 UTILITY METHODS

=head2 _start_process

   $proc = $hs->_start_process( %params )

This method starts a new IO::Async::Process which will be killed/waited for by
C<kill_and_await_finish>.

The paramters may include:

=over

=item command => ARRAY

Passed to C<IO::Async::Process::new>, giving the command to be run.

=item setup => ARRAY

Optional reference to an array to pass to the underlying C<Loop>
C<spawn_child> method.

=back

It returns the Process object.

=head2 _start_process_and_await_connectable

   $started_future = $hs->_start_process_and_await_connectable( %params )

This method starts a new process, and then waits until we can connect to a
given TCP port.

The following parameters must be given:

=over

=item C<connect_host>

=item C<connect_port>

The host and port to connect to, to determine if the process is ready.

=back

Other parameters are passed on to C<IO::Async::Process::new>.

=head2 kill_and_await_finish

   $fut = $hs->kill_and_await_finish()

This method kills all of our processes and returns a future which will resolve
once all of them have exited.
