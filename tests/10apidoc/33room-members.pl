Returns a Fixture, which when provisioned will create a new room on the user's
server and return the room id.

C<$user_fixture> should be a Fixture which will provide a User when
provisioned.

C<opts> can contain a boolean key called C<synced>, which determines whether to
perform a user /sync request after creating the room. This involves inserting
and checking for a 'm.room.test' event in the room state, which may be
undesirable in some cases. Defaults to 1.

Any other options are passed into C<matrix_create_room>, whence they are passed
on to the server.

It is generally easier to use C<local_user_and_room_fixtures>.

=head2 magic_room_fixture

   $fixture = magic_room_fixture(

Returns a Fixture, which when provisioned will create a new room on the user's
server and return the room id (and optionally the room alias).

The following may be passed as named parameters:

=over

=item requires_users => LIST

This should contain a list of user fixtures giving members of the new room. The
first user is the creator of the room; the others are joined to the room after creation.

=item with_alias => SCALAR

This is passed into C<matrix_create_and_join_room>, and will make the result include
the room alias as well as the room id.

=head2 local_user_and_room_fixtures

   ( $user_fixture, $room_fixture ) = local_user_and_room_fixtures( %opts );

Returns a pair of Fixtures, which when provisioned will respectively create a
new user on the main test server (returning the User object), and use that
user to create a new room (returning the room id).

The following can be passed as optional parameters:

=over

=item user_opts => HASH

Options to use when creating the user, such as C<displayname>. These are passed
through to C<setup_user>.

=item room_opts => HASH

Options to use when creating the room. These are passed into
C<matrix_create_room>, whence they are passed on to the server.
