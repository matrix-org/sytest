   wait_for_pusher_to_work( $sending_user, $room_id )

This is mostly a helper function for setup_push, but it might also help in some
other situations when configuring a pusher.

Because setting up a pusher is asynchronous, we need to wait until it becomes
active. We do this by having a second user (who shares a room with the user
that created the pusher) send messages to the room until a push arrives.
